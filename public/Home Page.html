                <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry">GEOMETRY</a></b> is one of the oldest subjects that are
                still in existence today. It is the study of mathematics
                that is concerned with the size, shapes, and figures of objects, as well as the qualities of space. As
                part of their geometry instruction, pupils learn all about the fundamental shapes, their properties,
                various formulas, areas and volumes, and many methods of sketching different shapes. However,
                through time, it has evolved into something much more significant, and it has become an important
                part of our everyday lives.

                    One of the most significant examples of geometry in everyday life is generated by the natural environment
                    that surrounds us. It is possible to detect geometrical designs and patterns in a variety of plant
                    materials, including leaves, flowers, stems, roots, bark, and the list goes on and on. The fact that the
                    human digestive system is organized like a tube within a tube confirms the importance of geometry in the
                    system. The leaves on the trees are different in terms of their shapes, sizes, and symmetries, among other
                    characteristics. For example, an orange is a sphere, and after peeling it, one can see how the separate
                    slices combine to form the perfect spherical. Varied fruits and vegetables have different geometrical
                    shapes; for example, an orange is a sphere.

                    Modern technology is the most widespread application of geometry in everyday life. Geometry is applied to
                    practically all of the basic concepts in almost any field, whether it be robotics, computers, or video
                    games. Because the principles of geometry are always available to computer programmers, they are able to do
                    their work efficiently. In video games, the virtual world is produced only because geometric computations
                    aid in the design of the sophisticated graphics that are used in the game’s virtual environment. A 2-D map
                    is used in the act of shooting in order to stimulate the 3-D world of video games, which is known as
                    raycasting. Because the computations for the vertical lines on the screen are carried out for each line on
                    the screen, raycasting helps to increase processing speed.

                    Geometry plays an important role in the design and construction of many different buildings and monuments.
                    Prior to the construction of architectural forms, mathematics and geometry aid in the creation of the
                    structural plan for the structure. The fixed characteristics of all types of architectural designs are
                    shaped by the theories of proportions and symmetry. The “Principles of Harmony” of Pythagoras, as well as
                    geometry, were used in the creation of architectural structures in the sixth century BC. Not only did the
                    fundamentals of mathematics, along with geometry, contribute to the enhancement of the aesthetics, harmony,
                    and religious significance of enormous constructions, but they also assisted in the mitigation of different
                    hazards coming from high-speed wind conditions.

                    Sports rarely misses an opportunity to put geometrical concepts to use in a unique situation. Geometric
                    shapes are taken into consideration when designing the structures of sports stadiums and sporting grounds.
                    Geometry is frequently used on athletic fields; for example, hockey, soccer, basketball, and football fields
                    are all rectangular in design. On the field, the corner kick locations, goal posts, arcs, D-section, and
                    centre circle have all been marked. Additionally, the pitches of numerous other sports, such as volleyball
                    and basketball, take geometrical considerations into mind, as evidenced by the presence of oval and circular
                    arcs that are plainly defined on the fields. When it comes to track fields, semicircular shapes are
                    frequently observed. Angular relationships are also important in forecasting the movement of the players,
                    improving their performance, and scoring a point.

            <h2><u>Using Programming to Calculate Area</u></h2>
            <aside>
                Programming languages provide immense support across various fields of work in today's world, including
                Geometry.
                For example, here is a sample Python script to calculate the area of a triangle using Heron's formula.
            </aside>
            <code>
                    # Three sides of the triangle is a, b and c:  <br/>
                    a = float(input('Enter first side: '))  <br/>
                    b = float(input('Enter second side: '))  <br/>
                    c = float(input('Enter third side: '))  <br/><br/>
          
                    # calculate the semi-perimeter  <br/>
                    s = (a + b + c) / 2  <br/><br/>
          
                    # calculate the area  <br/>
                    area = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) ** 0.5  <br/>
                    print('The area of the triangle is %0.2f' %area) <br/>
